*A Bare-bones Implementation of Automatic Differentiation in Python*

The Python scripts are simple implementations of some of the concepts discussed in "Introduction to Automatic Differentiation and MATLAB Object-Oriented Programming" by Richard D. Neidinger (https://doi.org/10.1137/080743627)

The scripts were written in the process of learning about automatic differentiation. They are based on operator overloading, and only depend on NumPy.
